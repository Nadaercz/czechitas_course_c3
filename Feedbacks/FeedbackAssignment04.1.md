# Feedback Final Project

I consider the project done, but there are few things I am not contend with.
1) you mix czech and english in the code (Seradit Podle Id button, Nacitam text,....) Either you just English or Czech (I would prefer English)
2) When you click the delete button in Dashboard, the changes are not propagated to UI - it can cause some issues (Edit item that was deleted)
3) The buttons in dashboard - please atleast write some text what the buttons do :wink:
4) There are still some methods in ToDoItemsRepository that can be improved (use FindAsync, not Find)


Otherwise good job, it does what is required :wink: Congrats!
